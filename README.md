**This paper aims to answer the question of what metric should be used to judge the Olympic candidacy of USA 
  gymnasts and to outline a statistical method that can be used presently and in the future to select the "best"
  gymnasts to comprise the United States women's Olympic team in order to maximize success.**

  In the **code** folder there is a *codeprocessfemale.Rmd* file and a *codeprocessmale.Rmd* file that generate the calculations, 
  parameters, figures, and tables presented throughout my paper. The function of each code step is described in each file.
